## Installation

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fitness-homepage.git
    cd fitness-homepage
    ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

    Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed. Then run:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Start the development server**:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

    This will start the development server and open the project in your default web browser. By default, it runs on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Usage

Once the development server is running, you can start editing the source files. The main files and directories are:

- `src/components`: Contains the React components.
- `src/App.js`: The main application file.
- `src/index.css`: Global CSS file where Tailwind CSS is imported.
- `public/index.html`: The HTML template.

### Customizing Tailwind CSS

To customize the Tailwind CSS configuration, edit the `tailwind.config.js` file. For example, you can add custom colors, spacing, etc.

```javascript
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        customBlue: '#1DA1F2',
        customGreen: '#17BF63',
        customRed: '#E0245E',
        customYellow: '#FFAD1F',
      },
    },
  },
  plugins: [],
}
